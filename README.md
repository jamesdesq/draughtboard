# Draughts

This project is my attempt to do David Whitney's code kata: 

https://github.com/davidwhitney/CodeDojos/tree/master/Draughts

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## The rules: 
- Click the "Who plays black" button to find out which player is playing black
- Click a piece to select it, then click the square you want to move it to
- The rules of draughts state that if a player can take a piece, they must do so. If you have a piece that's able to take one of your opponents pieces, and you try to select a different one, you'll see a message saying that you're not allowed to

# Building, testing and deploying
## Development server

If you want to run this locally, clone the repo to your machine, `cd` into the docroot and run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
